# LegacyTradeHelper
A WoW addon to help my guild with consumable trading.

# Installation
Download the code as a zip file and extract the `LegacyTradeHelper` folder (the one inside `LegacyTradeHelper-main`) into your appropriate WoW `Interface\Addons` folder (ie, `<wow dir>\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns`).

# Usage
Enter the command `/LegacyTradeHelper help` for in-game usage.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Sometimes the trade will go through but the trade window won't open. This can happen when you trade normally as well. If this does happen, just type `/reloadui` and try again :)

# Quick Start Guide
1. Target the player you wish to open trade with.
2. Enter the chat command, `/LegacyTradeHelper start`
3. Wait for the trade window to open or for a status message to appear.

You can also use `/lth` as an alternative slash command.

Happy Trading!
